# Comprehensive Guide to Deep Learning Loss Functions and NLP Techniques

Welcome to the **Comprehensive Guide to Deep Learning Loss Functions and NLP Techniques** repository! This collection serves as an essential resource for data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and NLP enthusiasts who are looking to deepen their understanding of key concepts, models, and methods. 

## üåü Overview

This repository features two detailed Excel sheets that combine theoretical and practical insights into deep learning and natural language processing:

## üìÇ Repository Contents

### 1. **Loss and Optimizer Functions** ([Models, Loss & Optimizers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11X31_S4pn-I9zwTzFI9F5wI9jHUgR6NkOQlscjHmeEA/edit?usp=sharing))
Dive into the intricacies of various optimizers and loss functions:
- **Type**: Classification (e.g., optimizer, loss)
- **Category**: Specific group (e.g., gradient-based)
- **Optimizer/Loss Function**: Name of the function/optimizer
- **Example**: Real-world use cases
- **Description**: Clear, concise explanations for quick understanding

Explore a curated list of NLP models and approaches:
- **Model ID** and **Name**
- **Primary Use Case** and **Task Type**
- **Modality** and **Training Corpus**
- **Developer Information** and **Open Source Status**
- **Technical Specs** (e.g., embedding vector length, attention heads, token limits)
- **Example Use Cases** and **Remarks**
