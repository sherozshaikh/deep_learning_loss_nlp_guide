# Comprehensive Guide to Deep Learning Loss Functions and NLP Techniques

Welcome to the **Comprehensive Guide to Deep Learning Loss Functions and NLP Techniques** repository! This collection serves as an essential resource for data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and NLP enthusiasts who are looking to deepen their understanding of key concepts, models, and methods. 

## üåü Overview

This repository features two detailed Excel sheets that combine theoretical and practical insights into deep learning and natural language processing:

1. **Loss and Optimizer Functions Explained** (`LossOptimizers`)
2. **NLP Models and Techniques** (`ModelList`)

## üìÇ Repository Contents

### 1. **Loss and Optimizer Functions** ([Models, Loss & Optimizers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11X31_S4pn-I9zwTzFI9F5wI9jHUgR6NkOQlscjHmeEA/edit?usp=sharing))
Dive into the intricacies of various optimizers and loss functions:
- **Type**: Classification (e.g., optimizer, loss)
- **Category**: Specific group (e.g., gradient-based)
- **Optimizer/Loss Function**: Name of the function/optimizer
- **Example**: Real-world use cases
- **Description**: Clear, concise explanations for quick understanding

### 2. **NLP Models and Techniques** ([NLP Topics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pg8MvfY0YJroF7mPY_c0bQgySPcgkEVh/edit?usp=sharing))
Explore a curated list of NLP models and approaches:
- **Model ID** and **Name**
- **Primary Use Case** and **Task Type**
- **Modality** and **Training Corpus**
- **Developer Information** and **Open Source Status**
- **Technical Specs** (e.g., embedding vector length, attention heads, token limits)
- **Example Use Cases** and **Remarks**
- **Pricing Input/Output** considerations

## üîÑ Continuous Updates
These Excel files are living documents. New optimizers, loss functions, NLP models, and detailed explanations will be added regularly. Stay tuned for updates and enrich your knowledge base with the latest in the field.

## üí° Future Plans
